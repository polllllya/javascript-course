// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMI susing the formula(you can even implement both versions)
// 3. Createa Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

//Coding Challenge #3
//There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
//Your tasks:
//1. Calculate the average score for each team,using the test data below
//2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//and print it to the console.Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
//as well(draw means they have the same average score)
//3. Bonus1: Include are quirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
//team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points.Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else -if blocks 
//4. Bonus2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points.Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
//Test data:
//Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110

/*const avgScoreD = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3;
